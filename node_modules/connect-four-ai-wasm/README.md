A high-performance, perfect Connect Four solver written in Rust, with bindings for Python and WebAssembly.

This library can strongly solve any Connect Four position and determine the optimal move.
For full details, performance benchmarks, and demos, please see the main
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/benjaminrall/connect-four-ai)

## Key Features

- **Perfect Solver**: Implements an optimised negamax search,
  which utilises alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table
  to quickly converge on exact game outcomes.

- **AI Player**: Features an AI player with configurable difficulty. It can play
  perfectly by always choosing the optimal move, or can simulate a range of
  skill levels by probabilistically selecting moves based on their scores.

- **Bitboard Representation**: Uses a compact and efficient bitboard representation for
  game positions, allowing for fast move generation and evaluation.

- **Embedded Opening Book**: Includes a pre-generated opening book of depth 8, which is
  embedded directly into the binary for instant lookups of early-game solutions.

- **Parallel Book Generator**: A tool built with `rayon` for generating new, deeper
  opening books.

- **Cross-Platform**: Available as a Rust crate, Python package, and WebAssembly module for
  seamless integration into a wide range of projects.

## Installation

To use the library, you can simply install it using `npm`:

```shell
npm install @benjaminrall/connect-four-ai
```

### Example Usage

This is a basic example of how to use the `Solver` to find the score of a position:

```javascript
import init, { Solver, Position } from "@benjaminrall/connect-four-ai";

async function run() {
  // Initialises the WASM module
  await init();

  // Creates a position from a sequence of 1-indexed moves
  let position = Position.fromMoves("76461241141");

  // Initialises and uses the Solver to calculate the exact score of the position
  let solver = new Solver();
  let score = solver.solve(position);

  console.log(score); // Output: -1
}

run();
```
